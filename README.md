An AI-powered Dungeons & Dragons Game Master system built with modern technologies, designed to provide an immersive tabletop roleplaying experience with optimized performance and enterprise-grade security.

## Project Overview

The D&D GameMaster AI is composed of three main services:

1. **DataReference**: A system for managing D&D reference data
   - Bronze database: Stores raw imported data
   - Silver database: Stores transformed and optimized data
   - REST API: Exposes the reference data securely
   
2. **LLMGameMaster**: An AI service for generating narrative content
   - Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o or Claude from Anthropic
   - Contextual responses based on campaign history, character data, and D&D reference data
   - API for integrating with the web application
   
3. **WebApp**: A web application for users
   - User authentication and management
   - Campaign and character creation and management
   - Interactive chat interface with the AI Game Master

## Architecture

The entire system is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose:

### System Components

1. **[DataCollection](documents/datacollection/README.md)** - Data scraping and collection
   - Scrapes D&D reference data from GitHub repositories
   - Downloads JSON files and images from official sources
   - Organizes data in structured output directories

2. **[DataReference](documents/datareference/README.md)** - ETL pipeline and reference data API
   - **Bronze Layer**: Raw data import from DataCollection
   - **Silver Layer**: Transformed and optimized reference data  
   - **API Layer**: Secure REST API with JWT authentication

3. **[LLMGameMaster](documents/llmgamemaster/README.md)** - AI-powered Game Master service
   - Integrates with OpenAI GPT-4o and Anthropic Claude
   - Generates narrative content, NPCs, locations, and quests
   - Provides context-aware responses using D&D reference data

4. **[WebApp](documents/webapp/README.md)** - Web application and user interface
   - ASP.NET Core MVC application with responsive design
   - User management with ASP.NET Identity
   - Campaign and character management
   - Interactive AI Game Master interface

WebApp ‚Üê‚Üí LLMGameMaster ‚Üê‚Üí Reference Data + Game Database
```

### Infrastructure
- **PostgreSQL databases**: Separate databases for each layer (Bronze, Silver, App)
- **Docker orchestration**: All services containerized and networked
- **Secure communication**: JWT tokens for inter-service authentication
- **Email integration**: User registration and notification system

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Internet connection for LLM API access
- Minimum 4GB RAM and 10GB disk space
