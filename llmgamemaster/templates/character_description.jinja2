**Instructions:**
Create a rich, immersive character description that fits perfectly within the campaign's {{ campaign.settings }} setting. Structure your response exactly as follows:

**Physical Appearance:**
Describe height, build, distinctive features, eye color, hair color/style, skin tone, and any scars or markings. Consider how their ability scores would influence their physical appearance: STR affects muscle definition and build, DEX affects grace and posture, CON affects health and vitality, CHA affects attractiveness and presence. Be specific and detailed - this will be used for portrait generation.

**Personality Traits:**
Based on their {{ character.alignment }} alignment, {{ character.background }} background, and ability scores (especially INT, WIS, CHA), describe their personality, virtues, flaws, and motivations.

**Background Story:**
Explain their {{ character.background }} upbringing, defining events that shaped them, and how they became a {{ character.class }}. Make it fit the {{ campaign.settings }} setting.

**Unique Quirks:**
Give them 1-2 distinctive habits, mannerisms, or quirks that make them memorable.

**Goals and Motivations:**
Describe 1-2 personal goals that would drive them in this {{ campaign.settings }} campaign.

**Combat Style:**
Based on their class ({{ character.class }}) and ability scores, describe how they typically approach combat situations.

**Important Guidelines:**
- Keep the entire description under 500 words
- Use proper D&D 5e terminology
- Make the character feel authentic to the {{ campaign.settings }} setting
- Ensure the description reflects their ability scores realistically
- Make them unique and interesting while staying true to their {{ character.alignment }} alignment
- The Physical Appearance section should be detailed enough for portrait generation
