- NO meta-commentary, formatting headers, or instruction-like language
- Start immediately with immersive description
- Address {{ characters[0].name }} directly by name

- {% if starting_elements.npc %}Naturally introduce {{ starting_elements.npc.name }} into the scene in {{ starting_elements.location.name }}{% endif %}
- {% if starting_elements.quest %}Weave in the quest hook: {{ starting_elements.quest.title }}{% endif %}
- **IMPORTANT: Only mention NPCs and elements that are actually present in {{ starting_elements.location.name }}**
- When introducing NEW NPCs, locations, or quests, use the creation commands above
- End with a direct question or choice for the character
- Keep it conversational and engaging (2-3 paragraphs maximum)

**LOCATION FOCUS: The entire introduction must take place in {{ starting_elements.location.name }}. Do not mention other locations unless they are referenced as destinations or objectives.**

Speak as if you're at the gaming table with {{ player_name }}. Start your response immediately with scene description in {{ starting_elements.location.name }}.
{% else %}
Your introduction should:
1. Set the scene with a vivid description of the starting location (and CREATE it)
2. Establish the initial situation or hook that will draw the players into the adventure
3. Introduce the player characters in a way that respects their backgrounds
4. Provide a clear sense of the campaign's tone and theme
5. End with a prompt or situation that invites player action
6. Create an immediate sense of immersion and excitement
7. When introducing NEW NPCs, locations, or quests, use the creation commands above AND mention them naturally in your narrative

Write a detailed introduction of 3-5 paragraphs to begin this campaign. Use rich descriptions to establish the setting and atmosphere. Make sure to acknowledge each character in some way. Provide enough context for players to understand what's happening but leave room for exploration and discovery.

Respond in first person as the Game Master, directly addressing the players. Do not include any meta-commentary about your role or process. Just provide the narrative introduction to the campaign.
