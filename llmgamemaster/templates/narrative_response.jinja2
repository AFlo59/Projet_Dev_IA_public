INSTRUCTIONS:
Create an engaging introduction for the D&D campaign for player {{ player_name }}.
Make the introduction personalized for the character in the campaign.

Follow these guidelines:
1. Begin with a vivid scene description that sets the mood and establishes the setting
2. Address the character directly by name ({{ player_name }})
3. Provide a clear hook or immediate objective for the character
4. End with a situation that prompts the character to take action

Keep your response under 3 paragraphs and make it engaging and evocative.
{% endif %}

{% if message_type == "campaign_start" %}
INSTRUCTIONS:
Create an engaging introduction to start the adventure with the player characters.

**CRITICAL: The character is currently located in {{ starting_elements.location.name }}. You MUST set the scene in this specific location and use ONLY the NPCs that are present there.**

Your introduction should:
1. **Set the scene with a vivid description of {{ starting_elements.location.name }}** - this is where the character actually starts
2. Establish the initial situation or hook that will draw the players into the adventure
3. **Begin with a short roleplay dialogue between the main NPC present in {{ starting_elements.location.name }} (e.g., {{ starting_elements.npc.name }}) and the player character.**
4. Introduce the player characters in a way that respects their backgrounds
5. Provide a clear sense of the campaign's tone and theme
6. End with a prompt or situation that invites player action
7. Create an immediate sense of immersion and excitement

{% if present_npcs %}
**IMPORTANT: The character is in {{ starting_elements.location.name }}. Only use these NPCs for dialogue and interaction in the introduction: {{ present_npcs | map(attribute='Name') | join(', ') }}. Do NOT invent or use any other NPCs. Do NOT mention NPCs from other locations.**
{% else %}
**IMPORTANT: The character is in {{ starting_elements.location.name }}. No NPCs are currently present in this location. Focus on the location description and atmosphere.**
{% endif %}

**LOCATION FOCUS: The entire introduction must take place in {{ starting_elements.location.name }}. Do not mention other locations unless they are referenced by NPCs as destinations or objectives.**

Write a detailed introduction of 3-5 paragraphs to begin this campaign. Make sure the scene is set in {{ starting_elements.location.name }} and any NPC dialogue comes from NPCs actually present in this location.
